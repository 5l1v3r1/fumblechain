    In this lesson, we will talk about public key and wallet address mismatch attacks.
</p>

<p>
    Wallet addresses are usually derived from public keys.
    Some blockchains, such as FumbleChain, virtually map wallet addresses and public keys one-to-one directly.
    That is, the public key IS the wallet's address. To be exact, in FumbleChain, the wallet address is the
    base64-encoded public key. In some blockchains, the address is the hash of the public key.

<h4>Case study: Lisk</h4>

<p>
    Some blockchains such as Lisk, however, produce wallet addresses in a slightly different way.
    The address and the public key are both generated using a passphrase as a starting point.
    A 256-bit public key is generated using the passphrase as a seed.
    A 64-bit wallet address is obtained by hashing the public key and truncating the resulting value to 64 bits.
    In other words, the wallet address is much shorter than the public key itself.
</p>

<p>
    The consequence of this is that it is much easier to brute-force the private key and address generation since the
    address is the public key truncated (less entropy than the public key itself).
    In other words, there exist multiple public keys for a same wallet.
    The security of wallets is therefore weakened because there are more chances of finding the private key with a
    brute-force attack.

<p>
    To protect from such an attack, the system should not use truncated wallet addresses.
